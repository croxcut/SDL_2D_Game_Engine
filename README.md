I have been shelving this project for over 6months now because im quite busy with things :D*

So for this year i want to publish a simple 2d Game engine for my game project ( which is not properly planed out by now )
this game engine uses SDL2 Library for most of its rendering and input elements, and it is written on C++.

This project is open source you can change, modify, or add anything to this project :D* ( it would be highly appreciated )
since my C++ kills is not up there yet, there are some sketchy ways i've done to just make it work it will need a huge
refactoring while im chugging along with it :D*.

Thank you have fun :D*
